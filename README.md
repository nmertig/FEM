# FEM

This repository is created to numerically compute resonance eigenvalues and resonance states based on the method of complex scaling. It is based on a finite element representation of the wave function along a complex dilated contour. It can treat une dimensional time-independent Hamiltonians, via an expansion of the Hamiltonian. It can also treat periodically kicked scattering systems, via a matrix representation of the complex-scaled time-evolution operator.
